# Notes

# Computation may take an extensive amount of time as we have to wait between two requests. Assume the cheapest model will need two hours of computation.
# It is reasonnable to assume a mistake may occur at some time for instance connextion issue, etc. For this reason we will files extensively.
# 
# The most common type of files used are .json. I know nothing about json because I come from a math formation. We will use .txt.
# we use three files:
# travels.txt distance.txt locations.txt
# locations.txt is all the coordinates of the model. 
# each line of travels.txt is two numbers (float) and a boolean (0/1)
# 0 means the travel hasn't been computed yet
# each line of distance.txt is two numbers: one distance, one time.
#
# At first computation we generate all the travels according to locations.txt. 
# An intelligent mind would forbidd to generate all travels, sadly i'm a donkey.
# Moreover I can justify the computation of all values by saying it can be interesting later with the model 

# At each iteration: 

#   open travels.txt. 
#   pick 1st line ending with a 0 
#   gather s and d (start & destination) and line number
#   close travels.txt
#   open distance.txt
#   compute with requests... the distance with s and d
#   write on the last line s, d and the result computed.
#   close distance.txt
#   open travels .txt. 
#   go to line number and replace the 0 with a 1
#   go next line and repeat.
