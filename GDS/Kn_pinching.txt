Rule used for pinching is the following: say we have two X_i, X_j \in S such that exactly one edge of them is of multiplicity 1, and one vertex in common.
Then denote by a_i,b_i,c_i their vertices, a_i being the one with two edges of multiplicity != 1, b_i = b_j = b.
Then it means that these two groups are covering only bc_i and bc_j. So, remove them and add X = b,c_i, c_j.
